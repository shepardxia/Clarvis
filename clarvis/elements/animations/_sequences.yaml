# Shared animation sequences - reusable frame snippets
# NOTE: This file documents available sequences. Each animation file
# defines its own sequences section for now (YAML doesn't support imports).
#
# Common patterns to copy into animation files:
#
# sequences:
#   blink:
#     - { eyes: "◔" }
#     - { eyes: "─" }
#     - { eyes: "◔" }
#
#   scan:
#     - { eyes: "◐" }
#     - { eyes: "◕" }
#     - { eyes: "◑" }
#     - { eyes: "◕" }
#
#   sparkle_eyes:
#     - { eyes: "✧" }
#     - { eyes: "✦" }
#     - { eyes: "★" }
#     - { eyes: "✦" }
#
#   sparkle_border:
#     - { border: "✦" }
#     - { border: "✧" }
#
#   talk:
#     - { mouth: "◡" }
#     - { mouth: "○" }
#     - { mouth: "◡" }
#     - { mouth: "─" }
#
#   arrow_pulse:
#     - { border: "▸" }
#     - { border: "▹" }
#     - { border: "▸" }
#     - { border: "►" }
#
# Usage in frames:
#   frames:
#     - { eyes: "◕", mouth: "◡" }
#     - $blink              # Expands to 3 frames
#     - { eyes: "◕", mouth: "◡" }
#     - $sparkle_eyes*2     # Repeats sequence 2 times (8 frames)
